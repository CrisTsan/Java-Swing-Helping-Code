# Java Swing Helping Code
This is for NTUA ECE Internet Programming course. Nevertheless you may use it for any other reason and particularly to learn the basics about Java Swing. You are encouraged to improve this code and make it even better (especially when the creator is a Java-Noob). 

## Purpose
This is made for educational reasons. It has to be explicitly explained in **detail**. It should assume little to no Java-Knowledge. And it should be helpful & reusable for the final Internet Programming exam.
